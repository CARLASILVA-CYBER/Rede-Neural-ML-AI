# Rede-Neural-ML-AI

This project is an artificial intelligence (IA) neural network developed by João Santos and Gonçalo Gomes. The neural network, implemented using the brain.js library, faces one challenge: probability of raining acordingly the data provided.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript: The neural network is implemented using JavaScript programming language, utilizing the brain.js library for neural network functionality.
- Neural Networks: The brain.js library is used to create and train neural networks. It provides a user-friendly interface for building and training various types of neural

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

2. To run a specific challenge, please run the following commands:
```bash
node ProbabilidadeDeChuva.js
```

## File Structure

- `sources/ProbabilidadeDeChuva.js`: The script file for the general challenge.
- `README.md`: The documentation file you are currently reading.
- `package.json`: The npm package configuration file.

## Credits

The IA neural network project was developed by:
- Professor PhD, Carla Silva - creator of the code base

Code review, testing and creation of new challenges:
- João Santos Nº2352
- Gonçalo Gomes Nº2400
